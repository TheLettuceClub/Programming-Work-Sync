# Programming-Work-Sync
 
This Should be all of my Summer 2024 Windows programming projects, as largely described in this document: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hvA-_lPkWWTtU5jzVRBp9LNvO4ayAJ8ufGYXV4eskXA/edit?usp=sharing
There are/will be some other projects in here, and many should serve as examples to others, both for what to and not to do when creating Windows apps.

Have Fun, I didn't.

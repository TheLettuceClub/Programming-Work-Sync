This companion disc contains source code files, include files,
and other files for the example programs presented in INSIDE
VISUAL C++ 1.5.

To install the files found on this companion disc, put the
companion disc in your CD-ROM drive and run the SETUP.EXE
program from Windows. Then follow the on-screen instructions
to install the book's example programs on your hard disk.

Compile a program by loading the project into Visual Workbench
and then choosing Build from the project menu. (You can also
type the programs in by hand. If you choose to do so, be sure
to create a new directory for the files.)



Known Bugs:

  The Dump and AssertValid functions should not appear in the
CMainFrame diagnostics section of the MAINFRM.CPP listing for
EX17A, as it does in the book. The file on this disc is correct.

Likely the yahoo page changed, and we are running old stuff.

Update cpan with:

c:
cd \bin\Strawberry\perl\bin
cpan update Finance::Quote

An error should show was URL failed. Today it was:
https://query2.finance.yahoo.com/v11/finance/quoteSummary/CSCO?modules=price,summaryDetail

Test in a browser. If 404, then the yahoo service might be down.
I tried with v10, and got 'unauthorzed" and "Invalid crumb".

Let's just switch providers
In quarterly.pl, line 32-ish
I tried exchange = usa or nasdaq. But setting it to alphavantage eventually worked.

The API key was not getting set, so in
AlphaVantage.pm, line 173 I have hard coded my API key.
Now it works, but is slow.

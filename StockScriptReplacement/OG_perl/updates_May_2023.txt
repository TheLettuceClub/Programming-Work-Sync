May, 2023 many things stopped working

1. update the libraries
	c:
	cd \bin\Strawberry\perl\bin
	cpan update (really: cpan -u)

	
	
Looks like the problem is that Yahoo started requring some amount of cookies:
	https://github.com/joshuaulrich/quantmod/issues/382


v6 is working, not v7, so in file
	C:\bin\Strawberry\perl\site\lib\Finance\Quote
		YahooJSON.pm, on line 38, changed the base URL from v7 to v6.
		
		But in the mean time, DBD::Oracle is a dependancy, and it messes things up big-time.
		
		
		
	
	
2. change $exchange from yahoo_json to usa
  now we need an API key
  
3. get a key at: Get an API key at https://www.alphavantage.co
	Other/self/QuattroAtHome@att.net
	generated the key
			RKO5B82AH10CX1LG
			
	This key has limits of:
		 free stock API service for our global community of users for up to 5 API requests 
		 per minute and 500 requests per day.
		 
	Somewhere in the URL we need to add
		apikey=RKO5B82AH10CX1LG
		
		
Add to environment (for cpan/updates and perl?)
set ORACLE_HOME=C:\bin\instantclient_21_10
set NLS_LANG=.WE8ISO8859P15
set ORACLE_USERID=test/test@test

Get a crumb from:

Edit the link in 
C:\bin\Strawberry\perl\site\lib\Finance\Quote
		YahooJSON.pm, on line 38, changed the base URL from v7 to v6.
